# RR and Leverage Calculator

This is a risk to reward (RR) calculator and a leverage calculator tool build for traders. Trading journals are a crucial part of trading to reflect and keep track of your trades, however it seems all trading journals lack a final total RR calculator and they also lack a leverage calculator. That is why I've built this tool. It also has an option to include the fees, that you're going to pay to the exchange, in the calculations.

The code is written to be used by Dutch users, so there might be some Dutch words used for the button text or the error messages for example, but if you just follow the code and the comments in the code (which are written in English), it's easy to figure out.
